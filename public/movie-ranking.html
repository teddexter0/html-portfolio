<h1>The Best Movies According to Ted</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time, so far I guess.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Marvel's Avengers End-Game</h3>
This is my favourite MCU. I love the story arc, perfectly made from way back in 2012!
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
Really cool sci-fi movie.
<h3>The Social Network</h3>
A great way to retell the tale of one of the biggest technology advancements in history, while still being a little goofy!
